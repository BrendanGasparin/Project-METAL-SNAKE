Project: METAL SNAKE is the creation of an on-premises physical cybersecurity lab with a LAMP stack web server and other services for web development, programming, and training in cybersecurity.  

I plan to thoroughly document this project in multiple media formats so remember to give this repository a star and give [me](https://github.com/brendangasparin) a follow on Github.

## The Waterfall Model of Project Management

I am using the Waterfall Model to manage the project. Currently I am in Phase 1, the initiation phase. When I get to Phase 3, the execution phase, I might use a more agile method of software development to build the network and configure and program required software.  

The Waterfall Model typically has five or six sequential stages that must be completed in order. These are:  

1. Initiation  
2. Planning and Design  
3. Execution  
4. Testing  
5. Installation / Deployment  
6. Closure and Maintenance  

Each of these phases have their own tasks and deliverables.  

**Phase 1** deliverables will be: 
- Business Case  
- Stakeholder Register  
- Project Charter  
- Project Manager Assignment  
- Scope Statement  
- Initial Risk Register  
- High-Level Project Plan  
- Requirements Document  
- Introductory Video  

As I am building Project: METAL SNAKE publicly, I will release these deliverables (with contact details redacted) using this Github repository and YouTube.

**Phase 1:** Initiation  

Today I completed the scope statement.  

I have noticed I am using Obsidian less and less to record document template information and instead opting to simply create the templates in Microsoft Word and Excel. If I were to take high-level notes and create the templates at the same time it would take me twice as long and I am strapped for time. I can copy and paste the template information into Obsidian later.  

### Currently Working On:  

- Business case, [Scope Statement](../docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Scope-Statement.pdf), Risk Register  

### Deliverables Completed:  

- [Scope Statement](../docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Scope-Statement.pdf)

**Phase 1:** Initiation  

Today I worked on the business case and completed the [Project Manager Assignment](../docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Project-Manager-Assignment.pdf) document. There is only one more day in this phase and I have so much to do.

**Phase 1:** Initiation  

Today I worked on the project initiation templates, focusing on the project manager assignment and initial risk register.  

I also worked on the business case. It is about 50% complete.

**Phase 1:** Initiation  

The project's initiation phase begins today. This Github repository has been created to keep track of project progress, documentation, and code files.  

Locally, I am using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) note-taking app to keep track of any necessary knowledge and planning for the project. This will make it easy to transfer any content I want to Github.  

In order to complete the Initiation phase I should produce the following deliverables this week:  

- Business case
- Stakeholder register
- Project charter
- Project manager assignment
- Scope statement
- Initial risk register
- Introductory video

The following initiation phase deliverables are also desirable, but were not completed due to time constraints, and because they can be completed in phase 2:  

- High-level project plan
- Requirements document

### Currently Working On:  

- Initiation phase document templates (for later re-use in other projects)  
- Business case  
- Stakeholder register (needs project completion date and project duration)  
- Github repository and this blog  

### Deliverables Completed:  

None

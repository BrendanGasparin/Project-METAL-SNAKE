**Phase 2:** Planning and Design  

I was still a bit behind on the business case, so I spent today completing it. It is a 52 page document.  

I am going to spend the rest of the night researching what is required by the Planning and Design phase so that I can begin it tomorrow.  

### Currently Working On:  

- [Business Case](../docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Business-Case.pdf)  

### Deliverables Completed:  

[Risk Register](../docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Risk-Register.pdf) 

## 2024-08-11  

**Phase 1:** Initiation  

Finished the Risk Assessment and Analysis section of the Business Case. Updated the Risk Register with management strategies.  

This is the last day of the Initiation Phase, which I have already extended by one week. I am going to burn the midnight oil to try and complete the Business Case and advance to Phase 2 tomorrow.  

### Currently Working On:

**Phase 1:** Initiation  

Finished the Benefits Realization section of the Business Case. Working on the Risk Assessment and Analysis. Updated the stakeholder register to include vendors. Updated the Risk Register with reworded risk descriptions and updated risk likelihoods, impacts, and risk scores. Uploaded the updated preliminary schedule, which I forgot to upload earlier this week.  

### Currently Working On:  

- Business Case, [Preliminary Schedule](../docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Preliminary-Schedule.pdf), [Risk Register](../docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Risk-Register.pdf), [Stakeholder Register](../docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Stakeholder-Register.pdf)

**Phase 1:** Initiation  

Updated [Preliminary Schedule](../docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Preliminary-Schedule.pdf) to account for the fact that the document deliverables are taking more time than anticipated. Added one week to initiation and planning phases to account for project documentation, and one week to closure phase to allow for sufficient software documentation.  

Updated the [Preliminary Schedule](../docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Preliminary-Schedule.pdf).  

Still working on the Business Case. Today I worked on the Benefits Realization section.  

Started Logan's training in HTML.

**Phase 1:** Initiation  

Got very little work done. Thinking of changing the project schedule to incorporate two weeks for initiation, planning, and closure phases to allow for concentration and completion of documentation.  

### Currently Working On:

### Deliverables Completed:  

None  

## 2024-08-06  

**Phase 1:** Initiation  

I did not complete any deliverables today but I did enlist an intern for help with the organization.  

### Currently Working On:  

- Business Case, Initiation Phase Templates  

### Deliverables Completed:  

None  

## 2024-08-05  

**Phase 2:** Planning & Design (and unfinished Initiation documentation)  

Completed a preliminary [risk register](../docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Risk-Register.pdf) and the [project charter](../docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Project-Charter.pdf). Catching up on my schedule.  

### Currently Working On:

## 2024-08-04  

**Phase 1:** Initiation  

Today I completed the scope statement, and a template for the risk register.  

This is the last day of the initiation phase and I am already behind schedule, as I haven't finished the business case or even started the project charter. I will work my buns off in the next 24 hours to try and catch up.  

I have noticed I am using Obsidian less and less to record document template information and instead opting to simply create the templates in Microsoft Word and Excel. If I were to take notes in Obsidian and create the templates simultaneously it would take me twice as long and I am too strapped for time. I can copy and paste the template information into Obsidian later.  

### Currently Working On:  

- Business case, [Scope Statement](../docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Scope-Statement.pdf), Risk Register  

### Deliverables Completed:

**Phase 1:** Initiation  

Today I worked on the business case and completed the [Project Manager Assignment](../docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Project-Manager-Assignment.pdf) document. There is only one more day in this phase and I have so much to do.

## 2024-08-02  

**Phase 1:** Initiation  

Today I worked on the business case. I realized I had done the financial projections wrong and had to restart them. The business case is taking forever.

Today I worked on the project initiation templates, focusing on the project manager assignment and initial risk register.  

I also worked on the business case. It is about 50% complete.

## 2024-07-29  

**Phase 1:** Initiation  

The project's initiation phase begins today. This Github repository has been created to keep track of project progress, documentation, and code files.  

Locally, I am using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) note-taking app to keep track of any necessary knowledge and planning for the project. This will make it easy to transfer any content I want to Github.  

In order to complete the Initiation phase I should produce the following deliverables this week:  

- Business case
- Stakeholder register
- Project charter
- Project manager assignment
- Scope statement
- Initial risk register
- Introductory video

The following initiation phase deliverables are also desirable, but were not completed due to time constraints, and because they can be completed in phase 2:  

- High-level project plan
- Requirements document

### Currently Working On:  

- Initiation phase document templates (for later re-use in other projects)  
- Business case  
- Stakeholder register (needs project completion date and project duration)  
- Github repository and this blog  

### Deliverables Completed:  

None

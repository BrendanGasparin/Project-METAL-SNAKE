# Project-METAL-SNAKE
Project: METAL SNAKE is the creation of a home cybersecurity lab with a LAMP stack web server, Minecraft, and Plex server.  

The website for the project is [https://brendangasparin.github.io/Project-METAL-SNAKE/](https://brendangasparin.github.io/Project-METAL-SNAKE/).

I plan to thoroughly document this project so remember to give the repository a like.

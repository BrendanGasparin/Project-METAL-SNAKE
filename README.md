## The Waterfall Model of Project Management

Project: METAL SNAKE is using the Waterfall Model for project management. In Phase 3, the execution phase, a more agile method of software development may be used to build the network and configure and program required software.  

The Waterfall Model typically has five or six sequential stages that must be completed in order. These are:  

1. Initiation  
2. Planning and Design  
3. Execution  
4. Testing  
5. Installation / Deployment  
6. Closure and Maintenance  

Each of these phases have their own tasks and deliverables.  

**Phase 1** deliverables will be: 
- [Preliminary Schedule](./docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Preliminary-Schedule.pdf)
- Business Case  
- [Stakeholder Register](./docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Stakeholder-Register.pdf)  
- Project Charter  
- [Project Manager Assignment](./docs/phase-1.0/METAL-SNAKE-Project-Manager-Assignment.pdf)

Project: METAL SNAKE is the creation of a home cybersecurity lab with a LAMP stack web server, Minecraft server, and Plex server for web development, programming, and training in cybersecurity.  

I plan to thoroughly document this project in multiple media formats so remember to give this repository a star and give [me](https://github.com/brendangasparin) a follow on Github.  

I am using the Waterfall Model of Project Management in order to manage the project. Currently I am in Phase 1, the initiation phase.
